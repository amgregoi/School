	This is only a small part of the complete functions of
	DiskExplorer. Further information is contained in the file
	editdisk.hlp. However this help file is written in Japanese,
	thus you cannot read it without a Japanese windows system
        (Not to mention fluency in Japanese!).
	
	Because I am not good at English, it is likely that there are
	some strange expressions within the program. My apologies for
	any misunderstandings.
	
	If you understand Japanese and English, please do get in touch
	with me - I am looking for volunteers to translate the help
	file and program into English.
