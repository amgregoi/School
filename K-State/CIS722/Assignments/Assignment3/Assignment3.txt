				CIS 722   			Fall, 2014
		       Assignment 3 
Due: 5:00pm on 10/2 (Thursday)

Describe what values does "boothead" assign to each field of each descriptor in the monitor GDT.
READ related pages in "Pentium Processor Family Developer's Manual" in Resources in KSOL and explain them in your own words.
If the same field appears more than once, you do not have to copy sentences.  Just give a reference
(e.g., "see the explanation for the AVL filed in the monitor CS segment (MCS) descriptor")

I will accept only .doc and .pdf files.
Name the name of your file "yourLastName_youFirstName.doc (or pdf)" and submit it in the file dropbox for Assignment 3.
