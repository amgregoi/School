		CIS722  Assignment 2			Fall, 2014

Due: 5:00pm on 9/16 (Tuesday)

1. Reverse compile the assembly program in pent_asm.pdf.
Note that there does not exist a unique solution (there may be several
variations).

The original program has the following program structure:
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
  char c1;
  int i1;
  char c2;
  short s1;
  char c3;
}  A;

A a1;

int x;

void func1(A *ap, int i) {
  int m, n;

  // the body has been deleted
}

void main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp) {
  A *ap = &a1;

  // the first several lines of the body have been deleted

  printf("a1 = %d,\t%d,\t%d,\t%d,\t%d\n", a1.c1, a1.i1, a1.c2, a1.s1, a1.c3);
  printf("x = %d\n", x);
}


The output of the original program is:
a1 = 0,	3,	6,	10,	15
x = 50

Compile and run your solution program to see if it prints the above output.

Hints:
 1. No variable (local or parameter) is mapped to a register
    as a register variable (just like variable x in fact(i) in fact.pdf).
    But recall that esi is a non-destructive register

 2. A post increment operator (e.g., x++) is used in the original program

 3. There is a sequence of assembly operations as follows:
    - A value of a variable (say x) is computed in a sequence of operations 
      in a register, say R0
    - The value in R0 is stored in x
    - In the next sequence of operations, the value in R0 is
      used as the value of x 
  

2. Draw a memory image of the execution of your solution program 
(just like the ones on 1-41 and 1-43).
You must use a drawing tool (hand-drawing will not be accepted).
Write variable names and values. If a variable is a parameter or 
a local variable, write its offset as well.
When you update a value of a variable, cross off the old value and write 
the new value next to the old value.
Do not erase the old value.  We want a history of the values in each variable.
When an invocation terminates, do not delete or cross off the corresponding
frame (It would make your figure difficult to read).


How to submit your work:
  1. Create a directory after your "LastName_FirstName" 
     ("Mizuno_Masaaki" in my case)
  2. put your program (.c file) and memory image file (only .pdf is accepted) 
     in the directory.
  3. zip the directory and submit it in the file dropbox named "Assignment 2"
