		Project 3   Phase 1 (Design)
  Due: 8:00am on 11/6 (Tuesday)
  
  Develop an object diagram, a class diagram, and use-case realizations in English
  	- I will accept a ppt (pptx), pdf, or jpg format
  	- If you hand-draw a diagram, you must scan it
  	- You do not need to write use-case realizations. However, I will ask you to describe use-case realizations
  	   when we meet.  If you cannot describe your use-case realizations, you will lose points
  	- You do not need to draw sequence diagrams
  	
  To submit your work, follow the steps described below:
  	1. Create a top-level directory after your LastName_FirstName
  		Example: Mizuno_Masaaki in my case
  	2. Copy your object diagram (.pptx, .pdf, or .jpg) and class diagram (.uml format) in the directory
  	3. Make a Zip file of your directory and submit it in the file dropbox named ÅgProject 3 Phase 1Åh
  	
  	Note: If you do not follow the above steps and I need extra steps to open your files, you will lose 
  	at least 5 % 
  
  This is strictly an individual project.  You are not allowed to discuss the project with other people.
  You can discuss with me or Ana.
