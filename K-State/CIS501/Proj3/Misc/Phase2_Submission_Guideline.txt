	Project 3  Phase 2 (Implementation) 
  Due: 8:00am on 11/29 (Thursday)
  Complete a program for Project 3
  	- You are not allowed to use database or hash (database) in your program
  	- You must use lambda expressions to search and delete an object in a collection
  	- Instantiation of dialog boxes must be done in the boundary class (VehicleRegistrationSystem.cs)
        - You may access files (read operation files and serialization) in classes other than 
           VehicleRegistrationSystem.cs
        - Do not forget to put attribute [Serializable{}] right before each class that need to be serialized.
  	- Update your object/class diagrams to match the final version of your program
  		You may add a few fields, associations, and classes.  However, your final design cannot
  		  be very different from the one I have approved at the design meeting
  		I will carefully check whether your program matches the design at the meeting
  	- Apply the Refactoring Rules (Chapter 4) to clean up your code
  	- Make sure to place logic in appropriate classes
  	
  To submit your work, follow the steps below:
  	1. make a directory after your LastName_FirstName (e.g., Mizuno_Masaaki in my case)
  	2. put your final class diagram (.uml), object diagram (ppt(x), pdf, or jpg), and the program 
  	   solution directory (remove the bin and obj directories) in your directory
  	3. make a zip file of the directory
	4. submit the zip file in the file dropbox named "Project 3 Phase 2"
	Note: If you do not follow the above steps and I need extra steps to open your files, you will lose at least 10 %
