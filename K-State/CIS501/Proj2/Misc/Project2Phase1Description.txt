		Project 2 Phase 1 (Design)
		
Due: 8:00am on 10/10 (Wednesday)
		
1. Develop an object image diagram to implement the Vending Machine
   Represent each object by a circle or rectangle, and each link by an arrow.
   If you have multiple objects, draw at least 2 (preferably 3) circles (rectangles) to represent the objects.
   
   Use a drawing program to draw your object diagram
   If your drawing program is not powerPoint, then copy your drawing and paste it on PowerPoint
   blank slide to submit (so you need to submit PowerPoint file (ppt or pptx)).
   
2. Draw a class diagram based on your object image diagram.
   For each class, you need to write the "Name", "Fields", and "Methods".
   For each association, you need to give the "Name" (field name) and "Multiplicities".

   You do not need to develop a sequence diagram.
   However, at the meeting, I will ask you to describe use-case realizations in English
   on your object/class diagrams.
   
Note: In this project, you are not allowed to use Dictionary (Hash).
        If you use Dictionary, often object structures become unimprotant (in small programs)
        and I will be unable to evaluate your design or design skills effectively.
   
How to submit your work:
 1. Create a directory named after your "lastname_firstname" (e.g., Mizuno_Masaaki in my case)
 2. Put your StarUml and PowerPoint files in the directory.
 3. Zip your directory and submit it to the file dropbox named "Project2 Phase1"
 
 Note: 1. If you do not follow the above submission procedure, you will lose at least 5% of the total score.
 
         2. This is strictly an individual project.  You may discuss problems only with me and/or Ana.
