		Project 2 Phase 2 (Implementation)
		
Due 8:00AM on 10/24 (Wednesday)

1. Complete your object diagram based on the discussion in our meeting. 
   I will check whether you can draw an object diagram correctly.
   
2. Complete your class diagram (with all the fields, associations, methods, and multiplicities correctly). 
   Your class diagram must match your object diagram.
   
   It may be difficult to identify all the methods (including private methods) in the design phase, so it is ok to 
   complete the methods in the class diagram after you finish your implementation (based on your code).
 
3. Develop a sequence diagram for the "Insert Coin" use-case.
   You do not have to show alternation or repetition.  
   Just represent all necessary method calls in sequence.
  
4. Complete the program.
   If you need to change your design, update your object/class/sequence diagrams as well.
   It is a common practice to change a design slightly when you implement it since you may not know every 
   detail of the program until you actually implement it.
   However, you must stick to the basic design which we came up with during your meeting with me.
 
5. Make a directory after your name "lastname_firstname" 
   Put your program's solution directory, class diagram (.uml file), and object diagram (.ppt or .pptx file) in the directory.
   
6. Make a zip file of the directory and submit it in the file dropboxes named "Project 2 Phase 2".
 
 In the meeting, I will check (1) if your object, class, sequence diagrams are correct (multiplicities, etc),
 (2) your code exactly matches your class diagram, and (3) the quality of your code (you may want to 
 review Chapter 4 (Refactoring) of Part 1 of the course notes).
 
 Note: This is strictly an individual project.  You may discuss problems only with me and/or Ana.
