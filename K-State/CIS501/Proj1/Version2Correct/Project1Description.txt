				Project 1 					Fall, 2012

Due: 8:00 on 9/26 (Wednesday)

The goals of the project:
1. To be able to draw a class diagram correctly from an object diagram
2. To be able to translate a design (a class diagram and use-case realizations) into code
3. (Hopefully) to start understanding the importance of "design" in OO program developments 
   and pleasure in not spending much time on debugging

1. Draw a class diagram for the Old Maid program based on the design we discussed in class
   (refer to Project1Design.pptx).
   You need to write all fields and methods identified in the design. 
   You also need to write all associations with names and multiplicities.
   You can add private methods and fields/associations if you need.
   While implementing, it is ok to add/delete private methods/fields/associations you have identified.
   (we never know the details until we actually implement it).
 
2. Implement the design in C#

Note:  In the meeting, I will check whether (1) your class diagram is correct (multiplicities, etc) with respect
   to the informal design in Project1Design.pptx, (2) your code exactly matches your class diagram, and 
   (3) each method in  your code is clearly written.
   
How to submit:
 1. Create a submission directory named after your "LastName_FirstName" (e.g., Mizuno_Masaaki in my case)
 2. Put (1) your star uml file and (2) your program (the whole solution directory, after removing the bin 
    and obj directories) in the submission directory
 3. Zip the submission directory and submit it to the file dropbox named "Project1"
 
Since I have to download and unzip all your submissions and read the submissions by the first several 
students by 9:00AM on 9/26, if you do not submit your work by 8:00, I will not accept it.
Even though you do not finish your work, you must submit it in time.
