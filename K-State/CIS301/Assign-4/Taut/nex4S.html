<h2>CIS301 Exercise 4</h2>

<em><font color="#8B0000">10 points; due Monday, February 27</font></em>
<hr>

<p>
We will extend a Python-coded interpreter for
propositional-logic formulas so that it can execute a single test case, generate all possible test
cases (build a "truth table"), and tell us whether or not a proposition is a tautology or is
satisfiable.

<p>
<em><font color="#8B0000">First, before you starting working on anything, read this entire
assignment page.  There are lots of hints, but you have to read
to the very end to collect them together and use them as needed.</font></em>

<p>
I have written an interpreter for this syntax of propositional
formulas, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>PROP</strong></font></tt>:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
PROP ::= PRIM  |  ~ PROP  |  ( PROP OP PROP )
OP ::=  ^  |  v
PRIM ::=  T  |  F  |  VAR
VAR is a single lower-case letter (but not 'v' !)
</pre></strong></font>
That is, a proposition is written with <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>T</strong></font></tt> (True), <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>F</strong></font></tt> (False),
<tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>~</strong></font></tt> (not), <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>^</strong></font></tt> (and), and <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>v</strong></font></tt> (or).  There are also variable
names, like <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>p</strong></font></tt> and <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>q</strong></font></tt>.  (Variables are working correctly in the starting version.
We'll fix this in a bit.)

<p>What
I've written for you so far reads a formula, parses it, and computes its meaning.
Here are samples:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
Type a parenthesized proposition: ~T
Parse tree is:
['~', 'T']
The proposition's meaning with no values for its vars is: False

Type a parenthesized proposition: (T ^ ~F)
Parse tree is:
['^', 'T', ['~', 'F']]
The proposition's meaning with no values for its vars is: True

Type a parenthesized proposition: ~(F ^ (~F ^ T) )
Parse tree is:
['~', ['^', 'F', ['^', ['~', 'F'], 'T']]]
The proposition's meaning with no values for its vars is: True
</pre></strong></font>
That is, the user starts the interpreter (types <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>python Run.py</strong></font></tt> in a
command window, or double-clicks
on the driver icon, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Run</strong></font></tt>) and then types a formula
(e.g., <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>~T</strong></font></tt>) which is then parsed into an operator tree
(e.g., <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>['~', 'T']</strong></font></tt>) from which the meaning is computed (<tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>False</strong></font></tt>).
<em><font color="#8B0000">Notice that and-or-formulas require matching parens.</font></em>
(I wrote the parser this way to keep it small and simple.
You are welcome to read its code.)

<p>
Here are the forms of operator tree constructed by the parser:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
PTREE ::=  PRIM  |  ["~", PTREE}  |  [OP, PTREE1, PTREE2]
PRIM is "T" or "F" or a one-letter string     
OP is "^" or "v"
</pre></strong></font>
The program traverses an operator tree and computes its
meaning, like we saw
in Chapter 8 of the Lecture Notes.

<p>
The interpreter can be downloaded from
<a href="Taut.zip"><tt><font color="#00008B">http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/301s12/Exercises/Taut.zip</font></tt></a>.   If you have trouble downloaded and unzipping the folder,
you can view the folder and its individual files at
<a href="Prop"><tt><font color="#00008B">http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/301s12/Exercises/Taut</font></tt></a>.

<p>
Download the <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Taut</strong></font></tt> folder and test <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Run.py</strong></font></tt>
on the three examples shown above.  Verify that you
obtain the same output as above.
Then, read the code for <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Run.py</strong></font></tt> and <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>EvalProp.py</strong></font></tt> to see how the output was produced.

<p>
<h4>Question 1. (1 point)</h4>
Modify the <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>EvalProp.py</strong></font></tt> so that it computes the meaning of formulas written with <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>v</strong></font></tt> (or).
(Important: <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>v</strong></font></tt> is the lower-case letter ``vee''.)
Test your revised interpreter on at least these required test cases:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
Type a parenthesized proposition: (T v ~T)
Parse tree is:
['v', 'T', ['~', 'T']]
The proposition's meaning with no values for its vars is: True

Type a parenthesized proposition: (T v (F ^ T))
Parse tree is:
['v', 'T', ['^', 'F', 'T']]
The proposition's meaning with no values for its vars is: True

Type a parenthesized proposition: ((F v F) ^ T)
Parse tree is:
['^', ['v', 'F', 'F'], 'T']
The proposition's meaning with no values for its vars is: False
</pre></strong></font>

<p>
<h4>Question 2. (4 points)</h4>
First off, try these tests on your interpreter:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
python Run.py
Type a parenthesized proposition: (p ^ T)
Parse tree is:
['^', 'p', 'T']
Output is: None

python Run.py
Type a parenthesized proposition: (p ^ q)
Parse tree is:
['v', 'F', 'q']
Output is: None
</pre></strong></font>
The problem is that variables <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>p</strong></font></tt> and <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>q</strong></font></tt> have no values.
Find the place in <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>eval</strong></font></tt> where variables are evaluated --- you will
see they receive the meaning, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>None</strong></font></tt>.   

<p>
We fix this by traversing the
operator tree and extracting all the variables inside the tree.
(For example, for the tree, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>['^', 'p', ['~', 'q']]</strong></font></tt>, the list,
<tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>['p', 'q']</strong></font></tt> is a list of the variables inside the tree.
Similarly,
<tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>['r', 'q']</strong></font></tt> is a list of the variables inside
<tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>['v', 'r', ['^', 'T', 'q']]</strong></font></tt>.
And <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>['p']</strong></font></tt> is a list of the variables inside <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>'p'</strong></font></tt>.)

<p>
You must implement this function in <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>EvalProp.py</strong></font></tt>:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
def evalVarList(t) : 
    """traverses  t  and builds a list of all the VARs embedded in  t
       pre: t  is a PTREE
       post: computes the "meaning" of  t  as  ans,  a list that holds all the VARs in  t.  
          The order of the vars does not matter, but no varname is repeated --- no duplicates!
       returns: ans
           Examples:  
           evalVarList(["v", "T", "p"])  returns  ["p"]
           evalVarList("T")  returns  []
           evalVarList(["^", ["~", "p"], ["v", "q", "p"]])  returns  ["p", "q"]
    """
</pre></strong></font>
Replace the "code stub" I have left for you with a working implementation.
(Big hint: the code you write will have the same structure as the <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>eval</strong></font></tt> function.)
Revise <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Run.py</strong></font></tt> as I have indicated in the comments in that module, and test
your coding of <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>evalVarList</strong></font></tt>.
Now, the program reads a proposition, parse it, extracts its variables, asks the user for
values for each variable, and prints the meaning.
Test your coding on at least these required test cases:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
Type a parenthesized proposition: (p ^ ~q)
Parse tree is:
['^', 'p', ['~', 'q']]
Variables in proposition are ['p', 'q']
Type  True  or  False  for variable p: True
Type  True  or  False  for variable q: True
For bindings: {'q': True, 'p': True}  The answer is: False

Type a parenthesized proposition: (q v (r ^ p))
Parse tree is:
['v', 'q', ['^', 'r', 'p']]
Variables in proposition are ['q', 'r', 'p']
Type  True  or  False  for variable q: False
Type  True  or  False  for variable r: True
Type  True  or  False  for variable p: True
For bindings: {'q': False, 'p': True, 'r': True}  The answer is: True

Type a parenthesized proposition: ~~F
Parse tree is:
['~', ['~', 'F']]
Variables in proposition are []
For bindings: {}  The answer is: False

Type a parenthesized proposition: (p ^ (q ^ ~p))
Parse tree is:
['^', 'p', ['^', 'q', ['~', 'p']]]
Variables in proposition are ['p', 'q']
Type  True  or  False  for variable p: True
Type  True  or  False  for variable q: False
For bindings: {'q': False, 'p': True}  The answer is: False
</pre></strong></font>
The last example shows that the variable list never has duplicate variables.

<p>
<h4>Question 3. (3 points)</h4>
Next, finish this function in <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>EvalProp.py</strong></font></tt>, which generates the ``truth table'' for a proposition:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
def evalAllTests(tree):
    """This function is called to supply the output for Questions 3 and 4.
        It computes all possible combinations of True-False values for the variables in  tree  
        and evaluates  tree  with each combination, printing the results. 
        For Question 4: In addition, the function states whether or not  tree  is 
        a tautology (true for all True-False combinations) and whether or not  tree  is 
        satisfiable (true for at least one combination)
       pre:  tree  is an operator tree in the format given above
       post: (see the actions stated above)
    """
    varlist = evalVarList(tree)
    allcombinations = generateBoolPermutations(len(varlist))  # 'len' means 'length of'
    # INSERT CODE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 3 AND 4
</pre></strong></font>
The function uses the list, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>allcombinations</strong></font></tt>, of all possible True-False combinations
for the number of variables in the <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>tree</strong></font></tt> to generate the truth table.
Modify
<tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Run.py</strong></font></tt> as indicated to call <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>evalAllTests</strong></font></tt> and test it on at least these
required test cases:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
Type a parenthesized proposition: ((r ^ q) ^ q)
Parse tree is:
['^', ['^', 'r', 'q'], 'q']
For bindings: {'q': True, 'r': True}   The answer is: True
For bindings: {'q': False, 'r': True}   The answer is: False
For bindings: {'q': True, 'r': False}   The answer is: False
For bindings: {'q': False, 'r': False}   The answer is: False

Type a parenthesized proposition: (T v ~p)
Parse tree is:
['v', 'T', ['~', 'p']]
For bindings: {'p': True}   The answer is: True
For bindings: {'p': False}   The answer is: True

Type a parenthesized proposition: ~~T
Parse tree is:
['~', ['~', 'T']]
For bindings: {}   The answer is: True
</pre></strong></font>


<p>
<h4>Question 4. (2 points)</h4>
Modify function <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>evalAllTests</strong></font></tt> to print whether or not the input proposition is a <em><font color="#8B0000">tautology</font></em>
or is <em><font color="#8B0000">satisfiable</font></em>.

<p>
A proposition is a tautology if its meaning is True for all possible True-False combinations.
For example, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>(p v ~p)</strong></font></tt> is a tautology; so is <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>q v (p v ~q)</strong></font></tt>; so is <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>~F</strong></font></tt>; so is <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>~(p ^ ~p)</strong></font></tt>.
But <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>(p v q)</strong></font></tt> is not a tautology; nor is <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>F</strong></font></tt>.

<p>
A proposition is satisfiable if its meaning is True for at least one True-False combination.
For example, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>(p ^ q)</strong></font></tt> is satisfiable; so is <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>(p v ~q)</strong></font></tt>; so is <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>~p</strong></font></tt>; so is <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>~F</strong></font></tt>.
Also, any proposition that is a tautology is satisfiable, too.
These propositions are not satisfiable: <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>(p ^ ~p)</strong></font></tt>; <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>~T</strong></font></tt>; <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>p ^ (q ^ ~p)</strong></font></tt>.

<p>
Add extra instructions to <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>evalAllTests</strong></font></tt> to print tautology/satisfiable information
so that these
required test cases execute as shown below:
<font color="#00008B"><strong><pre>
Type a parenthesized proposition: (p v ~p)
Parse tree is:
['v', 'p', ['~', 'p']]
For bindings: {'p': True}   The answer is: True
For bindings: {'p': False}   The answer is: True
is a tautology
is satisfiable

Type a parenthesized proposition: (p ^ (q v ~r))
Parse tree is:
['^', 'p', ['v', 'q', ['~', 'r']]]
For bindings: {'q': True, 'p': True, 'r': True}   The answer is: True
For bindings: {'q': True, 'p': True, 'r': False}   The answer is: True
For bindings: {'q': False, 'p': True, 'r': True}   The answer is: False
For bindings: {'q': False, 'p': True, 'r': False}   The answer is: True
For bindings: {'q': True, 'p': False, 'r': True}   The answer is: False
For bindings: {'q': True, 'p': False, 'r': False}   The answer is: False
For bindings: {'q': False, 'p': False, 'r': True}   The answer is: False
For bindings: {'q': False, 'p': False, 'r': False}   The answer is: False
is not a tautology
is satisfiable

Type a parenthesized proposition: (p ^ ~p)
Parse tree is:
['^', 'p', ['~', 'p']]
For bindings: {'p': True}   The answer is: False
For bindings: {'p': False}   The answer is: False
is not a tautology
is not satisfiable

<h3>About Python</h3>
Since Python looks and acts somewhat like C or Basic, it is straightforward
to use. 
There is a set of lecture notes at
<a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/200s08/Lectures/">
<tt><font color="#00008B">http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/200s08/Lectures/</font></tt></a>
and there is a terse language summary at
<a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/200s08/Lectures/999.summary.html">
<tt><font color="#00008B">http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/200s08/Lectures/999.summary.html</font></tt></a>.

<p>
You can do all the questions using only a notepad-like text editor.
Of course, you must learn  some basic operations
for Python lists and dictionaries (hash tables).
These structures are central to dynamic languages and they are
not primitive to compiler-based languages like C or C#.  They are well worth
learning!
Please see the
<a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/301s12/pythonstrucs.html">
notes on lists and dictionaries</a>
that I posted on the CIS301 home page.
Also, look at the code I have written in the <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>EvalProp.py</strong></font></tt> file; I wrote it in a style
that shows some standard ways of working with lists and dictionaries.


<h4>Solo or Pair-work OK</h4>
You may do this exercise solo or with a partner.
If you choose the latter, you must tell the instructor (Schmidt)
by classtime <em><font color="#8B0000">Wednesday, February 22</font></em>, who you and your partner are.
Once the instructor OKs your request, you and your partner can work together on the assignment.
(When you submit, both you and your partner will <em><font color="#8B0000">each submit the same zipped folder</font></em> on K-State Online.) 


<h4>Submission</h4>

Do the Questions in the order stated.  To obtain credit for answering
a Question, your modified <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>EvalProp.py</strong></font></tt> file must work correctly on all the required
test cases stated above for each Question.  The amount of coding you
must do is very little (about 50-60 lines to answer all four
Questions!), but it requires that you understand grammars, operator trees,
recursive function calls, lists, and dictionaries.

<p>
You <em><font color="#8B0000">must</font></em> follow these instructions to obtain credit for your
work:

<p>
Make a folder to hold your work.  Your folder must contain
the following:
<ol>
<li>
The final version of your <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>EvalProp.py</strong></font></tt> file, which must work correctly with the
<tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Run.py</strong></font></tt> and <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>ParseProp.py</strong></font></tt> files I am giving you for free.
<li>
For each Question that you answer correctly, you must include
a <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>txt</strong></font></tt> file that contains <em><font color="#8B0000">cut-and-paste printout</font></em> that shows how
each test case executed in the command window when you tested it.
(If you do not know how to cut-and-paste from a window into
an edit window, please ask the instructor!  It is easy to learn.)
<p>
The files that hold the successful test-cases-with-outputs for each question
will be named <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Q1.txt</strong></font></tt>, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Q2.txt</strong></font></tt>, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Q3.txt</strong></font></tt>, <tt><font color="#00008B"><strong>Q4.txt</strong></font></tt>.

<p>
To get credit for answering a question,
you must include all of the test cases
listed above for the question.

</ol>
Zip the folder and upload it at K-State online.

<p>
The Teaching Assistant will read your source code (please add comments as needed
to help him!), study your tests, and retry the tests for himself.  Perhaps the TA
will do extra tests if he is unsure about your coding.

<p>
Please do not hesitate to ask questions if you are uncertain about any
stage of the work.
