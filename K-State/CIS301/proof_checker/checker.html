<h2>Installing and Using the CIS301 proof checker</h2>

The CIS301 proof checker helps you write and check
correctness proofs like the ones presented in the CIS301
lecture notes.

The checker is meant to be ``lightweight'' in that it is small,
works with text files, and is used
with an edit window and a web browser.

<p>
To use the checker, you must have the Python language installed
on your computer.  If you have a Mac, you already have Python;
if you have installed Cygwin on Windows, you already have Python.
Many Windows machines already have Python as well.
(See the end of this note to learn about installing Python.)

<h4>Installing the Checker</h4>
From the CIS301 web page, download the zip-file,
<tt>cis301.zip</tt>.
Uncompress (unzip) the file, and extract from within it a copy of
the folder, <tt>cis301</tt>.  Save the <tt>cis301</tt>
folder on your computer in the place where you keep
your coursework folders (e.g., your <tt>My Documents</tt> folder,
if you are a Windows user).

<p>
Within the <tt>cis301</tt> folder, you will find a folder,
<tt>Checker</tt>, that holds the proof checker,
two folders of example programs to check (<tt>Ex</tt> and <tt>Exw</tt>),
and README and DOC files.


<h4>Using the Checker</h4>
You can start the checker by double-clicking on its icon
or by running it from within a command window:

<p>
The simplest way to start the checker is to enter (open)
the <tt>Checker</tt> folder and double-click on <tt>Check.py</tt>.
(You can do this if <tt>Check.py</tt> is displayed with an S-like or
snake-like icon, which stands for Python programs.)
Double-clicking
starts the checker, which will ask you for the filename to
check.
(Note: if <tt>Check.py</tt> is not displayed with the snake icon,
it likely means that you must install Python.  Please skip to the
bottom of this note to learn how.)

<p>
When you start <tt>Check.py</tt>, you will see a window appear
on your display, asking which file you wish to check.
You can use any of the examples in the folder <tt>Exw</tt>
(or <tt>Ex</tt>) to try.
Here is a sample dialog, where some person named ``schmidt''
installed the checker and asked it to analyze
the program,  <tt>Exw/while.py</tt>:
<pre>
+-------
|  Command-line usage: python Check.py [-args] FILENAME.py
   where  args  can be any or all of
      v : verbose mode: insert deduced asserts as comments in output
      a : include all possible asserts in proof output as premises
      x : insert header and assert code in output file for execution
      n : do not generate html file for viewing
      d : display internal data structures for debugging

   Entering interactive mode. (Press Enter to quit.)

   Current path is   C:\Documents and Settings\schmidt\cis301

   Type filename (relative to current path) to check:  Exw/while.py
   Type options (any or none of  vaxnd): v

     ... the analysis will be displayed here and also saved in two files  ...

|  Press  Enter  to repeat with this file; Press  q  to quit: 
+------
</pre>
The analysis creates two files, both saved where the input file lived:
<tt>whileA.py</tt>, the input file annotated with the results of
the checks; <tt>whileA.py.html</tt>, an html-formatted, multi-color version of
<tt>whileA.py</tt> that you can view in your web browser.  (The latter is useful
when you are developing a proof in stages.)

<p>
For repeated use of the checker, you should make a shortcut icon
and place it on your Desktop:
<ol>
<li>
In Windows XP, to generate a shortcut, open the  Checker folder,
right-click on  <tt>Check.py</tt>,  and select  ``Create Shortcut''.   Then,
move the shortcut icon to where you will find it most convenient to use,
e.g., your Desktop.
<li>
To use the checker, double click on its shortcut.
This will generate an interactive session, where you are asked
the name of the file that you wish analyzed and any execution options.
</ol>

<p>
While you are developing and checking a program, you can use an
edit window to type your program and a web browser to view the
results.
You can also repeat the analysis on the same file over and over;
this is useful for developing a program and its correctness
proof in stages.

<p>
You should study the 
<a href="cis301/README.txt"><tt>README.txt</tt></a> file that is included
within the <tt>cis301</tt> folder for advice about where to make a folder
that holds the programs you write and check.
There is also a
<a href="howtocheck.html">beginner's guide</a> you should read before
you write any programs/proofs of your own.

<h4>Using the checker from the command window</h4>

<p>
Unix and Linux users often like using a command window to edit and
run programs.  
You can also do this with a Windows machine.

<p>
Try opening a command window and typing <tt>python</tt>.
If you get the ``not found'' message, please read the
web page,
<a href="setpath.html">Using Python from a command window</a>
to learn how to set the Path variable on a Windows machine.
(If you are using Linux, update the <tt>PATH</tt> variable
within your startup script, e.g., <tt>.bashrc</tt>, so that it
includes the path to the folder where  <tt>python</tt> is installed).

<p>
Once you have the Path variable set, you can use the checker like this:
<tt>cd</tt> to  <tt>cis301</tt>, and type this at the
command line:
<pre>
python Checker/Check.py
</pre>
This starts the session.  If you prefer to use command-line arguments,
you may do so, like this:
<pre>
python Checker/Check.py -v Ex/while.py
</pre>
Then, by pressing the up-arrow key on your keyboard,
you can repeat the analysis over and over....

<p>
It is a bit of a nuisance to always start from the
<tt>cis301</tt> folder and always type the <tt>python Checker/Check.py</tt>
part.  If you are a Unix/Linux user, you can write an <em>alias command</em>
like this one and place it in your startup script (<tt>.bashrc</tt>):
<pre>
alias run301='python /home/Myname/Mystuff/cis301/Checker/Check.py'
</pre>
where <tt>/home/Myname/Mystuff/cis301/Checker/Check.py</tt> is the
complete path to the checker.
Then, you can start the checker from the command window like this:
<pre>
run301 -v Ex/while.py
</pre>
<!--
Also, Mr. Hoag has written an installation script that you can
use to install the alias command as a one-line batch-program
in your <tt>/usr/bin</tt> folder.
His script calculates the checker's path automatically.
To use it, please read <tt>HoagsREADME</tt> in the <tt>cis301</tt> folder.
-->


<h4>Installing Python if you do not have it</h4>

Say that you double-click on <tt>Check.py</tt> and it does not
start.  It is likely that your computer lacks Python.

<p>
To see if your computer has Python installed, you can try these
tricks:
<ol>
<li>
<em>On a windows machine:</em>
<p>
In your <tt>My Documents</tt> folder (or Desktop),
use Notepad to make a file named
<tt>Hello.py</tt> and place in the file the single line,
<pre>
raw_input("hello")
</pre>
Then, try double clicking on the file's icon to start the program.
If it starts and prints <tt>hello</tt>, you have python installed
correctly on your machine.
<p>
Or,
from the <tt>Start</tt> menu, use <tt>Search</tt> to search
<tt>all files and folders</tt> for the file,  <tt>python.exe</tt>.
If the search command finds it, it will show you where.
<p>
<li>
<em>
On a Linux machine (or MacOS that lets you start a Unix command
window):</em>
Type the command, <tt>which python</tt>
<p>
If Python is installed correctly, you will see the directory path to it.
</ol>

<!--
<p>
To see if your computer has Python installed,
open a command window, and type
<pre>
python
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
If Python is installed, you will see
<pre>
Python 2.6 (#1, May 18 2007, 07:40:45) 
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
</pre>
and you should be ready to go.  
(Hmmm, so if you cannot start <tt>Check.py</tt> by double-clicking on it,
then something odd has happened - your computer's
operating system has not connected Python as the start-up program
for <tt>.py</tt> files.  In this case, please speak with the instructor.)

<p>
<li>
If you see the message,
<pre>
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</pre>
Then you must install Python.
</ul>
-->

<p>
Important: your computer must have <em>Python 2.4 or newer up to
but not including Python 3.0</em>.
(This is normally not a problem --- most machines have 2.6 these days.)

<p>
If you must install Python, you will find it
easy:
Go to <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython">
<tt>http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython</tt></a>,
click on ``Active Python 2.6 Download Now'', then fill in your name and address
in the dialog box that appears,
then download and install Python Version 2.6.

Try your implementation by 
using Notepad to make a file named
<tt>Hello.py</tt> and place in the file the single line,
<pre>
raw_input("hello")
</pre>
Then,
try double clicking on the file's icon to start the program.
If it starts and prints <tt>hello</tt>, you are good to go.
(Or, try starting the program from a command window, like this:
<tt>python Hello.py</tt>)
